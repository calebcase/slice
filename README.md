# slice

Experiments with Go 1.18 generics and a theoretical Slice type. Many of the
examples of generics appear to be focused around parameterizing specific
functions (e.g. https://github.com/samber/lo or
https://github.com/jamespwilliams/slicetricks). This explores what it might
look like if instead a type was parameterized.
